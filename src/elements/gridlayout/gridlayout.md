The grid system is responisve layout with four breakpoints, mob - 375px, tab - 700px, desk - 1040px, la-desk - 1200px. It is designed mobile first so it is using min-width media-query. The three break points, 'tab', 'desk' and 'la-desk' have 12 column each, while 'mob' have four columns. To apply the grid system add the screen size following 'col' and the number of column the content will span over. Gutter and sidemargin size for each breakpoint can be edited in the variables file.
